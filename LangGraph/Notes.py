# LangGraph is a framework for building applications with LLMs, and it is built on top of LangChain. It provides a more structured way to build applications, with a focus on modularity and reusability. LangGraph is designed to be easy to use, even for those who are not familiar with LLMs or AI.
# LangGraph provides a set of tools and abstractions that make it easy to build applications with LLMs. It includes a set of pre-built components that can be used to build applications, as well as a set of utilities for working with LLMs. LangGraph is designed to be easy to use, even for those who are not familiar with LLMs or AI.

# What is a Graph?
# A graph is a collection of nodes and edges. Nodes represent entities, and edges represent relationships between those entities.
# In LangGraph, nodes can be thought of as components, and edges can be
# thought of as connections between those components.

# What is a Node?
# A node is a component in LangGraph. It can be thought of as a function that takes inputs and produces outputs.
# Nodes can be connected to other nodes to form a graph. Nodes can also have metadata, which can be used to provide additional information about the node.
# Nodes can be used to represent a wide variety of components, including LLMs, tools, and other components.
# Nodes can also be used to represent data sources, such as databases or APIs.
# Nodes can be used to represent any component that can be used in an application.
# Nodes can be used to represent any component that can be used in an application. Nodes can also be used to represent data sources, such as databases or APIs.

# What is a state?
# A state is a collection of data that is used by a node. States can be used to store data that is used by a node, such as the input to a node or the output of a node.
# States can also be used to store data that is used by multiple nodes, such as a database connection or an API key.
# States can be used to store data that is used by multiple nodes, such as a database connection or an API key.
# States can also be used to store data that is used by multiple nodes, such as a database connection or an API key.
# States can be used to store data that is used by multiple nodes, such as a database connection or an API key.

# What is an edge?
# An edge is a connection between two nodes. Edges can be used to connect nodes together to form a graph.
# Edges can also be used to represent relationships between nodes, such as a parent-child relationship or a dependency relationship.

# States hold data
# Nodes perform the operations

# Conversation Management is a key aspect of LangGraph, allowing for the
# management of conversations between users and the application. This includes
# the ability to manage the state of the conversation, as well as the ability to
# manage the flow of the conversation. Conversation management is a key aspect
# of LangGraph, allowing for the management of conversations between users and

# conversation, as well as the ability to manage the flow of the conversation.


# 1. Append user and assistant messages to the conversation
# 2. Truncate the conversation to a maximum length
# 3. Summarize the conversation if it exceeds a certain length
# 4. Use the conversation state to generate responses
# 5. Manage the state of the conversation - memory management
# 6. Short-term memory
# 7. Long-term memory

# Nodes are user-defined python functions that can be used to perform

# Schema defines what fields are available in the state, and what types those fields are.
